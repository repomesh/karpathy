[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/karpathy/pulls)

An agentic Machine Learning Engineer that trains state-of-the-art ML models using Claude Code SDK and Google ADK. This is a very simple implemenation demonstraing the power of Claude Scientific Skills for machine learning.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Claude Code installed and authenticated (see [installation guide](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code))

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/karpathy.git
cd karpathy
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `karpathy` directory with your API keys:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
AGENT_MODEL=your_model_name_here
```

The `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is required for the agent to function properly.

This is the same environment variable that will be copied to the `sandbox` directory so the agents can use any API keys you provide here.

## Quick Start

Run the startup script to set up the sandbox and start the ADK web interface:

```bash
python start.py
```

This automatically:
1. Creates a `sandbox` directory with scientific skills from Claude Scientific Skills
2. Sets up a Python virtual environment with ML packages (PyTorch, transformers, scikit-learn, etc.)
3. Copies your `.env` file to the sandbox
4. Starts the ADK web interface
5. Navigate to **http://localhost:8000** in your browser
6. Select `karpathy` in the top left under 'Select an agent'
7. All outputs will be in the `sandbox` directory so continue to monitor that as you converse with the agent

**Note:** Any files you want the agent to use (datasets, scripts, etc.) should be manually added to the `sandbox` directory.

## Claude Scientific Skills

This repository is designed to work with the **[Claude Scientific Skills](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills)** collection of ready-to-use scientific tools and workflows ([link](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills)). The `start.py` setup script creates a `sandbox` that includes scientific skills from this collection so the `karpathy` agent can leverage specialized ML libraries and scientific workflows. For full details on the skills themselves, see the upstream repository’s README and documentation [here](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills).

## Manual Usage

To set up the sandbox without starting the web interface:

```bash
python -m karpathy.utils
```

**Note:** Any files you want the agent to use (datasets, scripts, etc.) should be manually added to the `sandbox` directory.

To run the ADK web interface manually:

```bash
adk web
```

Then navigate to **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

## Enhanced ML Capabilities

If you want substantially more powerful ML capabilities through a multi-agentic system, sign up for [www.k-dense.ai](https://www.k-dense.ai). Currently in closed beta, launching publicly in December 2025.

## Upcoming Features

- **Modal sandbox integration** - Choose any type of compute you want
- **K-Dense Web features** - We might make some features from K-Dense Web available here based on interest
